### Definition of Machine Learning :
> Study of allowing computers to learn without explicit programming

### A program is said to learn from a well-posed learning problem when:
> Given some experience **E**, with respect to some task **T** and some performance measure **P**, A program is *Learning* if the performance of some task **T**, measured by some **P** improves with some experience **E**.

### Types of Learning Algorithms
* Supervised Learning
    * *Correct* answers are given explicitly
    * Model recieves feedback according to the answers that it predicted
    * Types of supervised learning tasks
        * Classification problem
            * Deals with discrete value outputs
            * May have multiple types of features to base predictions on (i.e. age, gender, race..)
        * Regression problem
            * Prediction of continuous value outputs
* Unsupervised Learning
    * No labels or feedback given from the 'teacher'
    * The point is to automatically find a categorization, structure, or patterns within the dataset
        * May open possibilities to further classification based on data
    * Cocktail party algorithm
